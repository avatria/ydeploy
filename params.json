{"name":"ydeploy","tagline":"A continuous build and deployment framework for hybris® ","body":"### Why ydeploy?\r\nydeploy is a continuous build and deployment framework for the hybris® commerce suite.\r\n\r\nydeploy integrates with the hybris platform build framework and attempts to reduce the amount of effort necessary to implement automated build and deployment tasks for hybris software across your environment landscape. Like the hybris build framework, ydeploy is built on Apache Ant and should be easy to pickup for most Java developers.\r\n\r\nydeploy is intended to be a simple, yet extensible tool. \r\n\r\nThe standard distribution provides a set of configurable build targets intended to address the most common build and deployment requirements. When necessary, the framework can be customized and extended to meet various other operational tasks related to administering hybris software.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nPlease see the ydeploy README.md for information on how to use ydeploy.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/avatria/ydeploy/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor questions, requests, feedback, or thank yous, please send a message to @zmcmahon-avatria.","google":"UA-55661001-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
